Here is an example of a plugin to highlight code:


Pretty neat, eh?

## GitHub flavored markdown (GFM)

For GFM, you can *also* use a plugin:
[\`remark-gfm\`](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown#use).
It adds support for GitHub-specific extensions to the language:
tables, strikethrough, tasklists, and literal URLs.

These features **do not work by default**.
👆 Use the toggle above to add the plugin.

| Feature    | Support              |
| ---------: | :------------------- |
| CommonMark | 100%                 |
| GFM        | 100% w/              |

~~strikethrough~~

* [ ] task list
* [x] checked item

## HTML in markdown

⚠️ HTML in markdown is quite unsafe, but if you want to support it, you can
use [\`rehype-raw\`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-raw).
You should probably combine it with
[\`rehype-sanitize\`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-sanitize).

## Components

You can pass components to change things:

\`\`\`js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import ReactMarkdown from 'react-markdown'
import MyFancyRule from './components/my-fancy-rule.js'

ReactDOM.render(
  <ReactMarkdown
    components={{
      // Use h2s instead of h1s
      h1: 'h2',
      // Use a component instead of hrs
      hr: ({node, ...props}) => <MyFancyRule {...props} />
    }}
  >
    # Your markdown here
  </ReactMarkdown>,
  document.querySelector('#content')
)
\`\`\`
